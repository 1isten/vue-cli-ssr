# vue-cli-ssr

Vue CLI 4 project configured to support [SSR](https://ssr.vuejs.org/).

> I **highly recommend** to use `yarn` instead of `npm` because `npm` is not reliable for resolving `package-lock.json`, sometimes it just doesn't respect the lock file. If you don't have `yarn` installed, using `npm` should still be ok though.

## Project setup
```bash
yarn # or `npm install`
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development (SPA)
```bash
yarn serve # or `npm run serve`
```

### Compiles and minifies for production (SSR)
```bash
yarn build # or `npm run build`

yarn start # or `npm start`
```
